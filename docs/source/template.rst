=============
Template Note
=============

This template note was created by the Style Police to assist with the coherent collation of information. It is a suggestion to be improved upon.

The above with upper and lower equals lines is a title and shows up as such in the TOC.

Subtitle
========

This on the other hand is a subtitle. Again it shows up as such in the table of contents.

Here is some code::

 for i = 1:10
 print 'Hello world'
 end

Here is a `link <index.html>`_ to another note. Note that the suffix is `.html` even though we write `.rst` files

Automatically generating the HTML
=================================
